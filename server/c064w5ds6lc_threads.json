    "text": "@[Geoffroy], before we make a final decision on whether to create a single database for the pedigree of all different horse types or to use a common database, I have the following questions:\n• The most crucial question is: to what extent would the system's speed be affected by having separate pedigree databases?\n• Each horse type (warmbloods, PRE, thoroughbreds) may or may not consist of specific breeds. For instance, warmbloods include Hanoverians, Oldenburgs, Westphalians, etc. PRE and thoroughbreds, however, are generally considered a single breed.\nTherefore, if we opt for a single pedigree database, we would need to segregate the horses by type in the pedigree. This means if a user enters a warmblood, they should not find PRE or thoroughbreds from which to search for their horse in the pedigree.\nHowever, there are exceptions, like with ponies, where about 0.5% of the horses in the pedigree might be warmbloods.\nSimilarly, in warmbloods, there might be about 0.1% thoroughbreds.\nAnd in PRE horses, there might occasionally be a warmblood in the pedigree.\nDespite these nuances, horses should be categorized in the pedigree database by type: warmblood, pony, PRE, thoroughbred, or western horse, and then associated with their specific breed under these categories.\nGiven these circumstances, what would you suggest as the best solution for HORSE24?\nAlso, if we now create a platform called LIVESTOCK24, it would be a platform where cows, sheep, pigs, and goats are offered. However, these animal types have nothing in common. There could be sub-breeds of cows or sheep, but a cow and a pig share nothing in their pedigree.\nWe need to consider what would be the best solution for us in this scenario.",

Normaly for each auction, a owner and user needs to be verifyed manualy from admin which @[Leticia] should develope with the help of @[Romina True].\n\nSo in admin we should have a site that shows breeder and owner who is connected to a lot. Then to the owner/breeder, it needs to show what was find in our User DB that looks like it could be the user. Then the admin needs to check and if he things it is the right connection, then he need to click a icon saying verifyed. So user and breeder or owner datas from the excel upload will be connected.\n\nLet me know if you understand what i mean?",

Or do we set up child sites for each domain? \nIn future dressage will be an attribute and a multiple selection is possible so next to dressage the horse can also have jumping or eventing and is therewith findable a multiple times. \nDo we need then to define a sub category on dressage horse in addition?

Or another messaging canal can also be used.\n\nI think other parts that need realtime  in admin will be same concept.

So then 3 days later we get a seperate excel file with new YouTube Video links to be added to each lot.\n&gt; So if we can export the excel file after a admin did many changes to each lot, we have last version excel file.

The import mapping is the process to link an excel file columns to product attributs for example.\nThen on product import page, you can choose the import mapping you want, then upload the excel file.\nTechnically we will use that mapping to compute the column values and insert into DB. So the import will not be creating new attributs but will be using attributs that already exist and put the values in the excel.

I am not sure in the moment whether I did not describe it properly or if there was some kind of issue why you changed it.? But I did not read any discussion on it in slack ..\nYou are right that essentially the logic of role and permission group is the same in the moment - assigning permissions to it ..

Could you explain how and when these product attributes will typically be created? It appears that attributes are only associated with individual products. Is this observation correct and, if so, could you detail the process of associating attributes with products? Also how will the redundancy of attributes between products in the same category be handled?\n• The product table contains the price column. Isn’t it rather a column of the Lot table?\nLaravel has packages that address the following:\nMedia (<https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-medialibrary/v11/introduction>)\nRoles and Permissions (<https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-permission/v6/introduction>)\nNotifications (<https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/notifications>)\nActivity logs (<https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-activitylog/v4/introduction>)\n\nWe think it can be beneficial to see the structure of the tables that these packages create in DB because it matches the expert’s design.\n\nIs the permission or role associated with the user or with another entity such as the Lot, Product, etc.? because the question was to know if an owner created a Lot in the Marketplace for example, and the lot was transferred to Auction, what would be the permission of the owner who created the lot in Marketplace on the lot at the auction level ?

So Horse, Pigeon, Watch, Cars… are Product Categories.  So here you will for a category horse, there is pedigree field, colors field which should be a select of following values… <https://xd.adobe.com/view/33e472b6-1ca6-4497-876f-c5ee6b5d95ef-66b7/screen/1ce4842e-3776-4335-9e74-f88d7be8352f>\n• Product is a definition of the values of a Product category attributes. It means it is on product that gender value, color value…. will be defined. So when you will upload an excel file for a lot, it will create products, plus lot definition values too.\n• Lot:  is the box that has the informations of pricing, starting bid, estimated price…. It also belongs to products. So a lot can be associate to a product or a list of products. It means for example a Lot 1 can contains a horse product “Bravo” and horse accessories product saddles, etc….. A lot can also be associated to only a horse product. We though so because later if a product is not sold, it can be associated to another Lot for another auction and have a different price…. Then Product is not linked definitly to a Lot. it can be imported to another lot, auction etc…\nI don’t know if i covered everything @[Geoffroy] @[Arnaud]",

We will probably have to have more discussions later, this is just so you can know the idea.\n\n```Requirements:\n- It must be possible to install the project on any machine with a single command (e.g. using docker)\n- Server route latency and server resource usage (php CPU, database accesses) must be optimized\n- As many users will see exactly the same thing (e.g. all users who go on an auction page will see the same data), consider a good caching approach\n- Server should be scalable to many users\n- Automated tests for the server (including stress tests)\n- It must be possible to write full realtime tests of auctions (including concurrent bids from different users etc.)\n- Handling of different product types (think about abstractions)\n- Avoid code duplication```",
