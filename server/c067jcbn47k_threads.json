There can be exceptions for specific cases, such as when selecting a user from a list of 1000, where typing initial letters might be more practical. However, this exception should only apply to about 2% of all dropdowns.\nFor implementation, would it be possible to modify the dropdown definition globally within the Tailwind framework, instead of adjusting each dropdown individually throughout the system?

One auction with 10 lots horses, 10 lots with riding accessoires, 10 lots with trucks.\n\nThe admin dashboard currently allows us to set different product categories and make their settings, attributes, layout etc. Good so far - but how now to process them in to auction and lot?\n\nWhen creating an auction we currently have no option to define in there which product categories it contains, we just have this lot type included to define fees and terms. The question is if we just rename this and this is enough?\n\nWhen adding now lots manually to an auction we currently have no option to match them to the auction I think. We just have the slug. So we need this I think?\n\nNeither we ask - when adding the lot - of which category it is, so that the right layout mask and tabs appear in admin. I think we have to do that as I have no other idea on how the dashboard differentiates which lot creation setting to display? The one we have currently is very tailored towards horses.",

Then, we would have the system to detect which lots are added to the auction and add the necessary fields that those lots need at an auction level.\n\nDo you think this is enough to cover the needs?\n\nI think that at a lot level is a must. But we could also add at an auction level, and that would also filter which lots can be added to that auction. So if you set the auction as only horses, you cant add horse accessories to that auction. If you're uploading, it will show as invalid. If you're adding in the auction settings, it simplely won't show",

We need it at auction level as every product category might have its own terms and conditions\n\nYes on lot level it is a must. We differentiate two ways of adding lots. First by upload, which is mostly a complete auction collection of lots and second manually\n\nIf lots are added by upload the system should identify if there are product categories in the respective column that are not added to the auction settings (I think this is then a DEV task?) And by upload it gets the information which lot settings to display in admin\n\nIf lots are added manually it should ask to which auction ( a lot shall never be added without auction) and dependent on the auction selected it should ask which product category this lot is (and give for selection only those that are taken in auction settings)\n\nCurrently adding lots manually after the auction was already created and lots have been uploaded is a more complex thing which we would like to improve in the new system",

Can we not make the page dependent on whether an OnLive or an Online auction is being created?\nWhere we need to be careful is if an auction switches from an OnLive auction to an Online auction and vice versa. This scenario can occur. Then there would be settings for parameters that would either have to be deleted or at least muted.

In the scenario where an auction switches from one type to another (e.g., from OnLive to Online or vice versa), muting parameters means these settings are no longer active or visible but remain stored in the system. Should the auction revert to its original type, the muted parameters can be easily and quickly reactivated without the need for reconfiguration or re-entry.\nMaybe functionality by introducing a state management for each parameter, with states such as \"active\", \"inactive\", or \"muted\". When changing the auction type, relevant parameters would be adjusted according to their new context by changing their state. A muted parameter remains in the system and retains its original settings but is temporarily disregarded in both the application's user interface and functionalities.",

We do also have employees sitting there with little experience in the system or seldomly doing it so the person sitting there is often a bit nervous.\n\nEvery wrong bid we have to cancel which interupts the bid flow and price amount the online user has to select\n\nWe have to do this template a bid like a child or senior telephone with big buttons and lots of space in between them\n\nSame applies for the buttons on the top right corner",

Live - this type does not include auction mechanisms but a date and time when it takes place. It opens the option to us to offer customers the presentation of collections on our websites\n4. Open Sale - this type does not include auction mechanisms and no date and time, it is the option to choose when we want to show a bundle of horses on our websites with not time frame of sale\n3. and 4. we will seldomly use but we want to include it already now to have it.\n\nIt should be possible to switch between the auction types as long the auction did not start (!)\n\nWhen switching the auction types the system shall ask with pop up or similar if we really want to do so and then add or remove all the necessary fields that are additionally needed or not longer needed.\n\nIn a second step the system shall recognize which of the new fields are now mandatory for this auction type and should only allow final saving and switching the type when all necessary fields are filled out.\n\nSo its kind of a two-steps-change involved.\n\nFor ONLIVE auctions we do need the fields from second screenshot including the streaming pictures. The streaming pictures should always be by default with standard H24 images and can then be exchanged if wished. We also like to have the streaming keys included. They are empty first and after saving the auction the system shall generate and show them in seperate fields. Each field should have a copy button next to it.\n\nI am not sure but did you already create the auctioneer page? (4th screenshot) If not, we need it please. It is the screen for the auctioneer where he can see the last five bids, the amount and name and country of the person that did the bid. If you need additional screenshots here please let me know\n\nWe do also need the reload users browser button from third screenshot",

We need to give it a name too.\n\nAs often the customers publish horses when the veterinarian documents are not ready. To avoid questions of horse buyers when veterinarian documents are available they upload then an information file for each horse in the veterinarian part (see attachment) that states when everything is available and this is annoying to upload the same file to each horse. In addition it falsifies our analytics concerning the veterinarian viewers as all users who looked at this info sheet and then on the real veterinarian documents are mixed up and we can not identify the real interested people. As we need to delete then this file and upload the real documents\n\nBy having it central in the auction settings we can control visibility easy and equally to all horses and deactivate it ones we have everything ready",

We can add multiple areas below with the +add button and we can switch vertically the order.\nIn the case of two columns per area we need to decide which element is shown first (Marked with 1) and which second (marked with 2) below the first element for the mobile view. By changing 1 and 2 of the two columns the order is defined.\n\nIn the second step we can add the elements per area. Each element has its fix size. So e.g. Image and pedigree need to have full width. In case one wants to put it in to a two-column area system should not allow it and show a failure message.\n\nIn the third step we can give the area a name and the option to be a dropdown in frontend or static. Therewith we are able to customize the names too.\n\nI am not sure if the three steps should be below each other on the right site of the screen or if the system shows only by clicking in to the relevant area which step/selection is required next.\n\nIf anything is not clear please let me know",

It is depending on the type of horse they sell and therewith dependent on the auction. Therefore we would like to have the option to set in the Auction Settings the order of pictures by default. So we can flexibly manage the sortage for all lots commonly per auction.\n\nFor sure the customer also still has the option to switch pictures in the overview as he wants to (3rd screenshot)\n\nAll other additional pictures next to the defined ones go in to the order last and without description.\n\nSo can you please insert the sortage option for pictures in the auction settings?",

Export should also be possible\n\nEdit lot winner flag - Opens menu to change winning flag after auction closed (maybe if bidding not finished show info box)\n\nView vet users - to be generic this should be called View document users or document requests, it shall open a list of all users with their names and mail adresses and when (date and time) and what kind of document (in the horse case: protocol or xrays) the user rquested. In the moment we do it at two different places but I would like to merge it into one place. It also needs the option there to export this list\n\nDelete last bid - Should send a request to the previous bidder per mail if he wants to accept to get the bid again, needs to be tailored so that this acceptance gets invalid when in that time new bid is done on lot or auction finished (so if the user is not answering fast enough on the request) if user accepts then delete the last bid and if user does not accept send information to organiser of auction\n\nDelete - thats clear I think",

Even if using it on frontend, we should only lazy load it when it's required\n2. datepicker is included, but it's only necessary when on a page that has a datepicker, and even then I think we only need it when someone actually clicks on datepicker. This one should also be lazy loaded\n3. Same for toastify, we don't need toasts to display the initial page, this should be lazy loaded",

But it also contains the logic to determine what happens when a button is pressed etc. Then it contains further logic to emit events, which is passed to a <https://sporthorses24.com/developers/katon/-/blob/main/admin-frontend/components/site/TeamList.vue|TeamList.vue>, which again contains both tailwind and logic.\n\nWhat this means is that in the end, it will be really hard to work with the logic of the teams tab in the admin. Because there will be different components, that all contain logic and communicate with each other. So if you want to change a behavior, it can get confusing fast. And it may also happen that if you try to change the appearance, you accidentally change the behavior, as it's all in the same file. Or the other way around.\n\nI am currently refactoring these components and improving the structure to have pure presentational components, and all the logic in composables. This will also allow us to test the appearance of the component in histoire. I just wanted to share this example to make it clear why a good structure on the client is so important.",

    "text": "Hi, @[Christian Bielert]\nActually, I heard about inertia.js but I don't have experience on using it.\nSo I investigated about inertia.js in details and found some Pros and Cons.\n\nThis is the comparison result from ChatGPT.\n```Both of the stacks you mentioned, Laravel API + Nuxt.js and Laravel + Inertia.js, are valid ways to build a modern web application, but they each have their own strengths and potential drawbacks. Here are some pros and cons to consider.\n\n**Laravel API + Nuxt.js**\n\n*Pros:*\n\n1. *Scalability*: This approach suits large-scale applications because it decouples the frontend from the backend. This division allows the frontend and backend to scale independently.\n\n2. *Modularity*: Also, because of the decoupling, the development team can work on the frontend and backend separately, which may increase development efficiency.\n\n3. *Flexibility*: Nuxt.js can be used as a static site generator or to build server-side rendering (SSR) applications, which can improve SEO.\n\n4. *Language*: By using a fully decoupled approach, frontend developers can work entirely in JavaScript.\n\n*Cons:*\n\n1. *Complexity*: This approach might be a bit overkill for small projects. \n\n2. *More requests to server*: Since the client and server are separate, more requests might need to be made between them, which could affect performance.\n\n\n**Laravel + Inertia.js**\n\n*Pros:*\n\n1. *Simplicity*: Inertia.js allows you to create fully client-side rendered, single-page apps, without much of the complexity that typically comes with this architecture.\n\n2. *Shared State*: Because Inertia.js operates within the context of a server-side framework, it's possible to share state directly from your server-side controllers into your JavaScript well.\n\n3. *Reduced API calls*: Not having to perform API requests for data could lead to a more seamless user experience.\n\n4. *Full-stack approach*: Laravel + Inertia.js is the way to go if you are a solo developer or small team and want to use one single technology for full stack developing.\n\n*Cons:*\n\n1. *Less Scalability*: Inertia.js is essentially a monolithic stack, which means that if your website receives a lot of traffic, scalability could be more difficult than with a decoupled architecture.\n\n2. *Server-side dependence*: Inertia.js is heavily dependent on the server-side, restricting you to use Laravel (or another server-side framework) for handling many aspects of your application.\n\nRemember that the best stack for you will depend on the specifics of your project, your familiarity with the technology, and what you're trying to accomplish.```\nIn a word, inertia.js is good for small projects and small teams because it uses one single technology for full stack developing.\nAnd it's not good for scalability and maintenance.\n\nHowever, Nuxt is good for scalability because the frontend and backend are developed separately, so the modularity is very good.\nAnd in this way, we use APIs to communicate between frontend and backend, so it's easy to find issues and keep maintenance.",

I've just finished to check design of project and this is not small project.\nBy the way, given the complexity and performance expectations of the project, I'd still prefer Nuxt + Laravel API for admin as well as user sides.\n\nBecause fist, using the same tech stack across the whole project would streamline our processes and minimize integration issues. I suppose, this can reduces the coding effort and improves development speed.\nAnd then as you know, Nuxt.js with Laravel API has strong built-in SEO capacities and high loading performance due to its server-side rendering. It is a perfect match for our high-performing web apps.\n\nThe importants thing is that Nuxt simplifies the overall development process with numerous modules, layouts, and middleware. It offers the good points of versatility in building complex and efficient web applications, exactly what our project requires.\n\nOf course, Livewire + Vue 3 has its own advantages but the features of Nuxt go beyond and align better with our project's needs.\nIn one word, I prefer Nuxt + Larave api\nHowever, this is just my proposition.\nThank you.",

Livewire maintain the communication between the back and front dynamically so it makes faster the coding flow.\n\nBy reading you, i think you miss understood. we will not be using Livewire + Vue3 for backend (Admin). We just need the Html and TailwindCss so we can use it to integrate using Laravel template engine Blade. Livewire uses Blade as template and AlpineJs for javascript actions.\n\nin the call today with @[Christian Bielert] i was saying as he requested to have component Stories, instead of doing Just Html and TailwindCss @[Thiago] can be using VueJs for the component presentation.\n\nThe Ideal would be to use do the templates using Html + TailwindCss + AlpineJs (for dynamic actions like, hide, show etc).\n\nAlso the Admin is the central part of the project that uses Laravel Tenancy for to manage child sites informations.  And tenancy has its conventions. maintaining the state with one stack (Livewire PHP) would be fine instead of adding another layer of Nuxt.\n\nThis is why we think Livewire would be good for just the Admin",

Because what you are saying is that you think, mixing together the presentation of the UI, together with the logic of the server, will make a faster coding flow. In my experience this is only true if everything, UI and logic, is built by the same developer. And it is also only true for building it the first time.

My initial leaning towards Livewire was driven by its seamless integration with Laravel, which facilitates a cohesive interaction between the UI and backend. This synergy in the tech stack is particularly beneficial for component management.\n\nHowever, I am also aware of the benefits offered by Nuxt.js, notably better flexibility and a distinct separation between UI and backend, which could simplify long-term maintenance.\n\nMy primary challenge at the moment is managing the switch between two tenants (children sites) during the same admin user session. We currently use the Hyn Tenancy package for tenant creation and management, and the admin has the ability to switch between different tenants and even the parent site for operations like auction creation, lot management, etc. We have relied heavily on session data to manage this effectively and securely, which was an additional reason for favoring Livewire.\n\nWith Nuxt.js, given the absence of native session management, we would need to find alternative methods for handling these switches. This is an aspect I have not fully explored yet, but it is clear that it will require some thinking to effectively address this need..",
