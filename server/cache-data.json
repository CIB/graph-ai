For example, a sealed bid auction might be more suitable for highly valuable or unique items where confidential bids can lead to higher final sale prices.\n\nKATON offers a comprehensive suite of features for creating and managing both Online and OnLive auctions. While these auction types share several core functionalities, they also possess distinct characteristics tailored to their specific formats. This document outlines the essential features common to both auction types and highlights the key differences between them.\nCore Features for All Auction Types\nAuction Title and Description\n\nEvery auction is equipped with a unique title and a descriptive text, providing a clear and concise overview of the auction's focus.\nImage Assignment\n\nA representative image is associated with each auction, offering a visual reference for potential bidders.\n\nStart and End Dates: Administrators set specific start and end dates for each auction, defining the time frame for bidding activities.\nIndividual Starting Price for Each Lot\n\nEach lot can be assigned a distinct starting price, allowing flexibility in pricing strategies based on the item's perceived value.\nBid Price Increment Settings\n\nThe platform enables setting custom bid increments for each auction. This feature allows control over how bids escalate, enhancing the bidding strategy.\nAuction Trailer\n\nA multimedia trailer can be added to provide a more engaging and comprehensive preview of the auction.\nTags for Advertising Campaigns\n\nAuctions can be tagged with relevant keywords to assist in targeted marketing and promotional efforts.\nCustomizable Lot Ordering\n\nA unique feature across both auction types is the ability to customize the order of lots. This can be done either manually in the admin panel or by uploading an order file in Excel format. This flexibility allows auctioneers to strategically arrange lots, irrespective of their lot numbers, to maximize interest and bidding activity.\nDistinguishing Features of OnLive Auctions\n\nIn addition to the shared features, OnLive auctions have specific functionalities that set them apart from purely online auctions:\nPre-Auction Integration (OnLive Exclusive)\n\nOnLive auctions offer the option to conduct a preliminary Pre-Auction. This initial phase functions like a standard auction, with the final bids setting the starting points for the OnLive event.\nDynamic Conclusion\n\nUnlike online auctions with a fixed end date, OnLive auctions conclude in real-time during the live event, adding an element of immediacy and excitement.\n\n\nTimed Online Auction\nPrinciple\n\nIn a Timed Auction, the end of the auction is determined strictly by the passage of time. A specific date and time are set in advance, marking the auction's closure.\nFunctioning \n\nAs the auction progresses, bidders place their bids. The bidding remains open and active until the predetermined closing time is reached. There is usually a visible countdown timer for the auction to keep participants informed about the remaining time.\nChallenges\n\nOne challenge is the potential for 'sniping,' where bids placed at the very last second can win the auction, sometimes before other bidders have the chance to respond. To counter this, some platforms implement an automatic time extension if a bid is placed near the end time.\n\n\nGrouped Online Auctions\nPrinciple\n\nGrouped auctions represent a sophisticated approach to online bidding, where multiple items (or 'lots') are categorized into distinct groups. This format allows bidders to focus on a specific set of related items, enhancing the auction experience and potentially increasing the value and interest in each group.\nFunctioning\nStructure\n\nIn these auctions, items are organized into groups, each containing multiple lots. This structure helps bidders to navigate and concentrate on their interests more efficiently.\nAuction End\n\nEach group has a predefined end time. However, these end times are dynamic and can change based on bidding activity, particularly late bids.\nDynamic Time Extension\n\nA critical feature of confluence grouped auctions is the extension of auction time for a lot if bids are placed in the final minutes. The specific duration for this extension is determined by the auction administrator. This mechanism keeps the auction competitive and fair, allowing bidders who act at the last minute to participate fully.\nVisibility\n\nOnce a lot is sold, it is marked distinctively, often with a transparent overlay, indicating its sold status while still allowing for its details to be viewed.\n\nGroup Closure: A group within the auction is considered closed only when all lots in that group are sold. This process ensures that interest in all items of a group is sustained until the end of the auction.\nNavigation\n\nThe auction platform typically allows users to navigate efficiently, with features such as clicking on group headings to view details of the sold lots.\n\n\nimage-20240204-114859.png\n\n\nOnLive Auction\n\nOnLive Auctions represent an innovative blend of traditional in-person auctions and modern online streaming technology. These auctions occur at a physical venue, similar to conventional auctions, yet they incorporate a unique element: real-time online participation. This hybrid model allows users to view a live stream of the auction and place bids from anywhere in the world, creating a dynamic and inclusive auction experience.\nPrinciple\n\nThe core principle of OnLive Auctions is to merge the excitement and authenticity of physical auctions with the accessibility and convenience of online platforms. At the physical venue, an auctioneer conducts the auction in real time, presenting each lot to an audience. Simultaneously, this event is streamed live to online users who can watch and participate in the bidding process from their devices. This dual approach ensures a broad reach and participation, enhancing the competitive atmosphere typical of auctions.\nFunctioning\n\nLive Stream Integration: A high-quality live stream broadcasts the auction from the venue to online users, ensuring they feel as if they are part of the event.\nBidding Process\n\nUsers can place bids online in real time. At the venue, an administrator inputs bids received from the physical audience into the system, which also registers online bids. This ensures a seamless and fair bidding process for all participants.\nAuctioneer's Dashboard\n\nThe auctioneer at the venue has a dashboard to view all incoming bids, both from in-person and online bidders, allowing for a smooth conduct of the auction.\nVisualization of Bids\n\nBids are visually displayed to the physical audience on a large LED wall, showcasing the bid amount and the flag of the bidder's country. This feature adds an international and interactive dimension to the event.\nVisibility and Navigation\nAlerts and Countdowns\n\nOnline users receive alerts when the auctioneer begins the final countdown for a lot - \"going once, going twice, and sold.\" This feature keeps them engaged and informed about the auction's progression.\nSale Confirmation\n\nBoth the physical and online audiences are notified when a lot is sold. For online users, a visual indicator confirms the sale, ensuring they are up-to-date with the auction's outcomes.\nTransition Between Lots\n\nAs one lot is sold and the next is introduced, online users witness this transition visually. The sold lot is archived under \"sold lots,\" and the new lot is displayed with its image and relevant parameters. This smooth transition helps online users to follow the auction's progression easily and prepares them for upcoming bidding opportunities.\n\n\n\"Buy Now\" Feature\n\nThe \"Buy Now\" feature represents a significant evolution in the auction landscape, offering an alternative to the traditional, competitive bidding process. This feature allows bidders to immediately purchase an item at a set price, bypassing the usual auction dynamics. It caters to both buyers seeking certainty and convenience, and sellers desiring a swift transaction.\nPrinciple of 'Buy Now'\n\nAt its core, \"Buy Now\" is a straightforward and efficient purchasing option within an auction context. It provides an immediate and definitive opportunity for buyers to acquire an item at a predetermined price, circumventing the need to engage in potentially lengthy and uncertain bidding wars. This feature is integrated into the auction platform, coexisting with the standard bidding process.\nFunctioning of 'Buy Now'\n\n\"Buy Now\" introduces a fixed price for the item, distinctly set apart from the fluctuating nature of auction bids. Upon finding the \"Buy Now\" price acceptable, a bidder can instantly confirm their purchase, thereby ending the auction for that particular item.\n\nThis option is typically available from the start of the auction until the first traditional bid is placed or until the \"Buy Now\" option is exercised.\n\n\nGeo-Restricted Online Auctions\n\nGeo-restricted online auctions are a specialized form of online auction where the visibility and participation are limited to users from specific countries pre-selected by the administrators. This approach is often adopted for reasons such as compliance with local laws, shipping constraints, or targeted marketing strategies. By restricting access based on geographic location, these auctions offer a tailored and regulated bidding environment.\nPrinciple of Geo-Restricted Online Auctions\n\nThe fundamental principle behind geo-restricted online auctions is to create an exclusive auction environment that is accessible only to users in certain countries. This exclusivity is often driven by the need to adhere to the legal and commercial requirements specific to different regions. The auctions are hosted online, similar to standard online auctions, but with an added layer of geo-restriction.\nFunctioning of Geo-Restricted Online Auctions\n\nCountry Selection: Before the auction goes live, administrators select the countries whose residents will be allowed to access and participate in the auction. This selection is often based on legal, economic, or strategic considerations.\nGeo-Location Verification\n\nWhen a user attempts to access the auction, their IP address is checked to determine their geographic location. Only users from the approved countries are granted access.\nParticipation Controls\n\nUsers from non-approved countries are either redirected to a notification page explaining the restriction or are simply unable to see or interact with the auction listings.\nVisibility and Navigation\n\nFor users within the approved countries, the online auction operates typically. They can browse listings, place bids, and view auction progress as they would in any standard online auction.\n\nUsers attempting to access the auction from non-approved countries receive clear communication about the restrictions, often with reasons for the limitation. This helps in maintaining transparency and user trust.\n\n\nOnline Auction Freeze Feature\n\nIn the realm of online auctions, technical issues can arise, potentially disrupting the auction process. To address this, a specialized feature known as the \"Auction Freeze\" function is implemented. This feature allows administrators or superadmins to temporarily halt the auction, creating a controlled environment to resolve technical problems without compromising the auction's integrity or the participants' experience.\n\nThe Auction Freeze feature is a crucial tool in ensuring the integrity and smooth operation of online auctions. By allowing for immediate response to technical issues and providing a transparent communication channel with participants, this feature upholds the reliability and trustworthiness of the auction platform. Implementing such a feature demonstrates a commitment to providing a fair and uninterrupted auction experience for all participants.\nPrinciple\n\nThe Auction Freeze feature is designed to safeguard the fairness and continuity of online auctions in the face of technical difficulties. It acts as an emergency control, enabling authorized personnel to pause the auction process instantly. This pause is critical for maintaining the validity of the auction, especially in high-stakes bidding environments, where uninterrupted functionality is paramount.\nFunctioning\nActivation\n\nIn case of a technical issue, an admin or superadmin can activate the freeze feature. This immediately halts all auction activities, including bidding, countdowns, and any other dynamic elements.\nTroubleshooting\n\nDuring the freeze, developers can investigate and rectify the issue without the pressure of ongoing auction activities. This pause is essential for a thorough and unobstructed resolution process.\nControlled Resumption\n\nOnce the issue is resolved, the admin has the capability to resume the auction. They can choose to restart the auction from the exact point of interruption or adjust the conditions if necessary (e.g., extending time limits).\nNotification System\n\nAs soon as the auction is frozen, an automated notification system alerts all participants about the pause. This notification includes the reason for the interruption and, if possible, an estimated duration for the resolution process.\nStatus Updates\n\nRegular updates are provided to keep participants informed about the ongoing resolution efforts and the expected time for resuming the auction.\nResumption Notification\n\nOnce the issue is resolved, participants are notified about the auction's resumption, including any adjustments made to the auction parameters post-freeze.\n\n\nEliteBid Invitational\n\nEliteBid Invitational represents a specialized format of online auctions, tailored to create an exclusive, invitation-only environment. This model is designed for auctions where participation is limited to a select group of pre-registered and vetted users. Such a format is particularly suitable for high-value, niche, or confidential auctions where the organizer seeks to maintain a controlled and curated audience.\nPrinciple\n\nThe core principle of EliteBid Invitational is exclusivity and personalization. Unlike open online auctions, where anyone can participate, this format is restrictive, aiming to create a more private and secure auction environment. This approach is especially appealing for auctions involving high-value items, sensitive goods, or when a more intimate and focused bidding audience is desired.\nFunctioning\nPre-registration and Vetting\n\nUsers must pre-register and may undergo a vetting process to be eligible for participation. This ensures that only qualified and interested bidders are in attendance.\nInvitation Dispatch\n\nOnce registered and approved, users receive a personalized invitation to participate in the auction. This invitation may include a unique access code or a secure link to the auction platform.\nRestricted Access\n\nAccess to the auction is strictly controlled. Only users who have received and accepted the invitation can enter the auction platform and participate in bidding.\nVisibility\n\nInvited participants gain access to auction listings that are not visible to the general public. This ensures privacy and exclusivity for the items being auctioned.\n\nThe platform provides a streamlined and intuitive interface, allowing invited bidders to easily navigate through the listings, place bids, and monitor auction progress.\n\nRegistered participants receive real-time updates and reminders about the auction, including lot closings, bid status, and any changes in auction dynamics.\n\n\nEnhanced Security Feature for Online and OnLive Auctions\nBidder Account Suspension Capability\n\nThe implementation of the bidder account suspension feature in OnLive Auctions is a critical enhancement for ensuring a secure and fair bidding environment. It empowers administrators to swiftly and effectively manage bidder participation, particularly in cases where identity verification or bid legitimacy is in question. This feature reinforces the commitment to conducting transparent and trustworthy auctions, maintaining the high standards of integrity that are foundational to the OnLive Auction experience.\nFunctionality\n\nImmediate Suspension Access: During an Online or OnLive Auction, administrators have the capability to suspend a bidder's account in real-time. This is facilitated through an interface where each bidder's name is accompanied by a suspension icon. By clicking this icon, administrators can instantly deactivate the account of the bidder in question.\nSecurity and Verification\n\nThis feature is crucial in scenarios where there are uncertainties or concerns about a bidder's identity or the legitimacy of their bidding activity. It acts as a vital safeguard against potential fraudulent or unverified participants, thereby preserving the auction's integrity.\nImpact of Suspension\n\nOnce an account is suspended, the affected user is immediately restricted from further participation in the auction. Their existing bids can be reviewed and potentially invalidated, depending on the circumstances and at the discretion of the auction administrators.\nNotification and Clarity\nAffected bidders are notified about the suspension of their account, along with an explanation for this action. This approach ensures transparency and provides an opportunity for the bidder to understand and possibly rectify the situation that led to their suspension.\n\nPlease extract nodes and relations from the above text.\nYou can use the following relation names in particular (but you can also invent other relations where necessary):\nIS_A - When A is an instance of the concept B, or concept A is a subset of concept B\nEQ - When A is semantically equivalent to B\nExtract them in the following JSON format:\n{ \"nodes\": [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"baz\"] }, { \"relations\": [[\"foo\", \"IS_A\", \"bar\"], [\"bar\", \"EQ\", \"baz\"]] }": "{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    \"Manage Auction Type\",\n    \"Online Auction\",\n    \"OnLive Auction\",\n    \"Auction Title and Description\",\n    \"Image Assignment\",\n    \"Individual Starting Price for Each Lot\",\n    \"Bid Price Increment Settings\",\n    \"Auction Trailer\",\n    \"Tags for Advertising Campaigns\",\n    \"Customizable Lot Ordering\",\n    \"Pre-Auction Integration\",\n    \"Dynamic Conclusion\",\n    \"Timed Online Auction\",\n    \"Grouped Online Auctions\",\n    \"OnLive Auction Principle\",\n    \"Buy Now Feature\",\n    \"Geo-Restricted Online Auctions\",\n    \"Online Auction Freeze Feature\",\n    \"EliteBid Invitational\",\n    \"Enhanced Security Feature\",\n    \"Bidder Account Suspension Capability\",\n    \"Core Features for All Auction Types\",\n    \"Distinguishing Features of OnLive Auctions\",\n    \"Standard Online Auction Types\",\n    \"Ascending Bid Auction\",\n    \"Sealed Bid Auction\",\n    \"Dutch Auction\"\n  ],\n  \"relations\": [\n    [\"Online Auction\", \"IS_A\", \"Manage Auction Type\"],\n    [\"OnLive Auction\", \"IS_A\", \"Manage Auction Type\"],\n    [\"Auction Title and Description\", \"IS_A\", \"Core Features for All Auction Types\"],\n    [\"Image Assignment\", \"IS_A\", \"Core Features for All Auction Types\"],\n    [\"Individual Starting Price for Each Lot\", \"IS_A\", \"Core Features for All Auction Types\"],\n    [\"Bid Price Increment Settings\", \"IS_A\", \"Core Features for All Auction Types\"],\n    [\"Auction Trailer\", \"IS_A\", \"Core Features for All Auction Types\"],\n    [\"Tags for Advertising Campaigns\", \"IS_A\", \"Core Features for All Auction Types\"],\n    [\"Customizable Lot Ordering\", \"IS_A\", \"Core Features for All Auction Types\"],\n    [\"Pre-Auction Integration\", \"IS_A\", \"Distinguishing Features of OnLive Auctions\"],\n    [\"Dynamic Conclusion\", \"IS_A\", \"Distinguishing Features of OnLive Auctions\"],\n    [\"Timed Online Auction\", \"IS_A\", \"Online Auction\"],\n    [\"Grouped Online Auctions\", \"IS_A\", \"Online Auction\"],\n    [\"OnLive Auction Principle\", \"IS_A\", \"OnLive Auction\"],\n    [\"Buy Now Feature\", \"IS_A\", \"Online Auction\"],\n    [\"Geo-Restricted Online Auctions\", \"IS_A\", \"Online Auction\"],\n    [\"Online Auction Freeze Feature\", \"IS_A\", \"Online Auction\"],\n    [\"EliteBid Invitational\", \"IS_A\", \"Online Auction\"],\n    [\"Enhanced Security Feature\", \"IS_A\", \"Online Auction\"],\n    [\"Bidder Account Suspension Capability\", \"IS_A\", \"Enhanced Security Feature\"],\n    [\"Ascending Bid Auction\", \"IS_A\", \"Standard Online Auction Types\"],\n    [\"Sealed Bid Auction\", \"IS_A\", \"Standard Online Auction Types\"],\n    [\"Dutch Auction\", \"IS_A\", \"Standard Online Auction Types\"]\n  ]\n}",

The sold lot is archived under \"sold lots,\" and the new lot is displayed with its image and relevant parameters. This smooth transition helps online users to follow the auction's progression easily and prepares them for upcoming bidding opportunities.\n\n\n\"Buy Now\" Feature\n\nThe \"Buy Now\" feature represents a significant evolution in the auction landscape, offering an alternative to the traditional, competitive bidding process. This feature allows bidders to immediately purchase an item at a set price, bypassing the usual auction dynamics. It caters to both buyers seeking certainty and convenience, and sellers desiring a swift transaction.\nPrinciple of 'Buy Now'\n\nAt its core, \"Buy Now\" is a straightforward and efficient purchasing option within an auction context. It provides an immediate and definitive opportunity for buyers to acquire an item at a predetermined price, circumventing the need to engage in potentially lengthy and uncertain bidding wars. This feature is integrated into the auction platform, coexisting with the standard bidding process.\nFunctioning of 'Buy Now'\n\n\"Buy Now\" introduces a fixed price for the item, distinctly set apart from the fluctuating nature of auction bids. Upon finding the \"Buy Now\" price acceptable, a bidder can instantly confirm their purchase, thereby ending the auction for that particular item.\n\nThis option is typically available from the start of the auction until the first traditional bid is placed or until the \"Buy Now\" option is exercised.\n\n\nGeo-Restricted Online Auctions\n\nGeo-restricted online auctions are a specialized form of online auction where the visibility and participation are limited to users from specific countries pre-selected by the administrators. This approach is often adopted for reasons such as compliance with local laws, shipping constraints, or targeted marketing strategies. By restricting access based on geographic location, these auctions offer a tailored and regulated bidding environment.\nPrinciple of Geo-Restricted Online Auctions\n\nThe fundamental principle behind geo-restricted online auctions is to create an exclusive auction environment that is accessible only to users in certain countries. This exclusivity is often driven by the need to adhere to the legal and commercial requirements specific to different regions. The auctions are hosted online, similar to standard online auctions, but with an added layer of geo-restriction.\nFunctioning of Geo-Restricted Online Auctions\n\nCountry Selection: Before the auction goes live, administrators select the countries whose residents will be allowed to access and participate in the auction. This selection is often based on legal, economic, or strategic considerations.\nGeo-Location Verification\n\nWhen a user attempts to access the auction, their IP address is checked to determine their geographic location. Only users from the approved countries are granted access.\nParticipation Controls\n\nUsers from non-approved countries are either redirected to a notification page explaining the restriction or are simply unable to see or interact with the auction listings.\nVisibility and Navigation\n\nFor users within the approved countries, the online auction operates typically. They can browse listings, place bids, and view auction progress as they would in any standard online auction.\n\nUsers attempting to access the auction from non-approved countries receive clear communication about the restrictions, often with reasons for the limitation. This helps in maintaining transparency and user trust.\n\n\nOnline Auction Freeze Feature\n\nIn the realm of online auctions, technical issues can arise, potentially disrupting the auction process. To address this, a specialized feature known as the \"Auction Freeze\" function is implemented. This feature allows administrators or superadmins to temporarily halt the auction, creating a controlled environment to resolve technical problems without compromising the auction's integrity or the participants' experience.\n\nThe Auction Freeze feature is a crucial tool in ensuring the integrity and smooth operation of online auctions. By allowing for immediate response to technical issues and providing a transparent communication channel with participants, this feature upholds the reliability and trustworthiness of the auction platform. Implementing such a feature demonstrates a commitment to providing a fair and uninterrupted auction experience for all participants.\nPrinciple\n\nThe Auction Freeze feature is designed to safeguard the fairness and continuity of online auctions in the face of technical difficulties. It acts as an emergency control, enabling authorized personnel to pause the auction process instantly. This pause is critical for maintaining the validity of the auction, especially in high-stakes bidding environments, where uninterrupted functionality is paramount.\nFunctioning\nActivation\n\nIn case of a technical issue, an admin or superadmin can activate the freeze feature. This immediately halts all auction activities, including bidding, countdowns, and any other dynamic elements.\nTroubleshooting\n\nDuring the freeze, developers can investigate and rectify the issue without the pressure of ongoing auction activities. This pause is essential for a thorough and unobstructed resolution process.\nControlled Resumption\n\nOnce the issue is resolved, the admin has the capability to resume the auction. They can choose to restart the auction from the exact point of interruption or adjust the conditions if necessary (e.g., extending time limits).\nNotification System\n\nAs soon as the auction is frozen, an automated notification system alerts all participants about the pause. This notification includes the reason for the interruption and, if possible, an estimated duration for the resolution process.\nStatus Updates\n\nRegular updates are provided to keep participants informed about the ongoing resolution efforts and the expected time for resuming the auction.\nResumption Notification\n\nOnce the issue is resolved, participants are notified about the auction's resumption, including any adjustments made to the auction parameters post-freeze.\n\n\nEliteBid Invitational\n\nEliteBid Invitational represents a specialized format of online auctions, tailored to create an exclusive, invitation-only environment. This model is designed for auctions where participation is limited to a select group of pre-registered and vetted users. Such a format is particularly suitable for high-value, niche, or confidential auctions where the organizer seeks to maintain a controlled and curated audience.\nPrinciple\n\nThe core principle of EliteBid Invitational is exclusivity and personalization. Unlike open online auctions, where anyone can participate, this format is restrictive, aiming to create a more private and secure auction environment. This approach is especially appealing for auctions involving high-value items, sensitive goods, or when a more intimate and focused bidding audience is desired.\nFunctioning\nPre-registration and Vetting\n\nUsers must pre-register and may undergo a vetting process to be eligible for participation. This ensures that only qualified and interested bidders are in attendance.\nInvitation Dispatch\n\nOnce registered and approved, users receive a personalized invitation to participate in the auction. This invitation may include a unique access code or a secure link to the auction platform.\nRestricted Access\n\nAccess to the auction is strictly controlled. Only users who have received and accepted the invitation can enter the auction platform and participate in bidding.\nVisibility\n\nInvited participants gain access to auction listings that are not visible to the general public. This ensures privacy and exclusivity for the items being auctioned.\n\nThe platform provides a streamlined and intuitive interface, allowing invited bidders to easily navigate through the listings, place bids, and monitor auction progress.\n\nRegistered participants receive real-time updates and reminders about the auction, including lot closings, bid status, and any changes in auction dynamics.\n\n\nEnhanced Security Feature for Online and OnLive Auctions\nBidder Account Suspension Capability\n\nThe implementation of the bidder account suspension feature in OnLive Auctions is a critical enhancement for ensuring a secure and fair bidding environment. It empowers administrators to swiftly and effectively manage bidder participation, particularly in cases where identity verification or bid legitimacy is in question. This feature reinforces the commitment to conducting transparent and trustworthy auctions, maintaining the high standards of integrity that are foundational to the OnLive Auction experience.\nFunctionality\n\nImmediate Suspension Access: During an Online or OnLive Auction, administrators have the capability to suspend a bidder's account in real-time. This is facilitated through an interface where each bidder's name is accompanied by a suspension icon. By clicking this icon, administrators can instantly deactivate the account of the bidder in question.\nSecurity and Verification\n\nThis feature is crucial in scenarios where there are uncertainties or concerns about a bidder's identity or the legitimacy of their bidding activity. It acts as a vital safeguard against potential fraudulent or unverified participants, thereby preserving the auction's integrity.\nImpact of Suspension\n\nOnce an account is suspended, the affected user is immediately restricted from further participation in the auction. Their existing bids can be reviewed and potentially invalidated, depending on the circumstances and at the discretion of the auction administrators.\nNotification and Clarity\nAffected bidders are notified about the suspension of their account, along with an explanation for this action. This approach ensures transparency and provides an opportunity for the bidder to understand and possibly rectify the situation that led to their suspension.\n\nPlease extract nodes and relations from the above text.\nYou can use the following relation names in particular (but you can also invent other relations where necessary):\nIS_A - When A is an instance of the concept B, or concept A is a subset of concept B\nEQ - When A is semantically equivalent to B\nExtract them in the following JSON format:\n{ \"nodes\": [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"baz\"] }, { \"relations\": [[\"foo\", \"IS_A\", \"bar\"], [\"bar\", \"CUSTOM_RELATION\", \"baz\"]] }": "{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    \"auction_type\",\n    \"Online Auction\",\n    \"OnLive Auction\",\n    \"Core Features\",\n    \"Auction Title and Description\",\n    \"Image Assignment\",\n    \"Individual Starting Price for Each Lot\",\n    \"Bid Price Increment Settings\",\n    \"Auction Trailer\",\n    \"Tags for Advertising Campaigns\",\n    \"Customizable Lot Ordering\",\n    \"Pre-Auction Integration\",\n    \"Dynamic Conclusion\",\n    \"Timed Online Auction\",\n    \"Grouped Online Auctions\",\n    \"Dynamic Time Extension\",\n    \"OnLive Auction Principle\",\n    \"Bidding Process\",\n    \"Auctioneer's Dashboard\",\n    \"Visualization of Bids\",\n    \"Alerts and Countdowns\",\n    \"Sale Confirmation\",\n    \"Transition Between Lots\",\n    \"Buy Now Feature\",\n    \"Geo-Restricted Online Auctions\",\n    \"Online Auction Freeze Feature\",\n    \"EliteBid Invitational\",\n    \"Enhanced Security Feature\",\n    \"Bidder Account Suspension Capability\"\n  ],\n  \"relations\": [\n    [\"Online Auction\", \"IS_A\", \"auction_type\"],\n    [\"OnLive Auction\", \"IS_A\", \"auction_type\"],\n    [\"Core Features\", \"EQ\", \"Essential Features in Online and OnLive Auctions on KATON\"],\n    [\"Auction Title and Description\", \"IS_A\", \"Core Features\"],\n    [\"Image Assignment\", \"IS_A\", \"Core Features\"],\n    [\"Individual Starting Price for Each Lot\", \"IS_A\", \"Core Features\"],\n    [\"Bid Price Increment Settings\", \"IS_A\", \"Core Features\"],\n    [\"Auction Trailer\", \"IS_A\", \"Core Features\"],\n    [\"Tags for Advertising Campaigns\", \"IS_A\", \"Core Features\"],\n    [\"Customizable Lot Ordering\", \"IS_A\", \"Core Features\"],\n    [\"Pre-Auction Integration\", \"IS_A\", \"Distinguishing Features of OnLive Auctions\"],\n    [\"Dynamic Conclusion\", \"IS_A\", \"Distinguishing Features of OnLive Auctions\"],\n    [\"Timed Online Auction\", \"IS_A\", \"Standard Online Auction Types\"],\n    [\"Grouped Online Auctions\", \"IS_A\", \"Standard Online Auction Types\"],\n    [\"Dynamic Time Extension\", \"IS_A\", \"Grouped Online Auctions\"],\n    [\"OnLive Auction Principle\", \"IS_A\", \"OnLive Auction\"],\n    [\"Bidding Process\", \"IS_A\", \"OnLive Auction\"],\n    [\"Auctioneer's Dashboard\", \"IS_A\", \"OnLive Auction\"],\n    [\"Visualization of Bids\", \"IS_A\", \"OnLive Auction\"],\n    [\"Alerts and Countdowns\", \"IS_A\", \"OnLive Auction\"],\n    [\"Sale Confirmation\", \"IS_A\", \"OnLive Auction\"],\n    [\"Transition Between Lots\", \"IS_A\", \"OnLive Auction\"],\n    [\"Buy Now Feature\", \"IS_A\", \"auction_type\"],\n    [\"Geo-Restricted Online Auctions\", \"IS_A\", \"auction_type\"],\n    [\"Online Auction Freeze Feature\", \"IS_A\", \"auction_type\"],\n    [\"EliteBid Invitational\", \"IS_A\", \"auction_type\"],\n    [\"Enhanced Security Feature\", \"IS_A\", \"auction_type\"],\n    [\"Bidder Account Suspension Capability\", \"IS_A\", \"Enhanced Security Feature\"]\n  ]\n}",

For instance, some auctions might be traditional ascending bid auctions, while others could be sealed bid auctions or Dutch auctions. Each type has its own rules and strategies, impacting how users engage with the auction and how the final sale is determined.\n\nBy managing different \"auction_type\", KATON can offer a diverse range of auction experiences, appealing to a broader audience and accommodating different types of goods or services being auctioned. It also allows for more flexibility in auction design, which can be tailored to suit the specific needs of each auction or the items being bid upon.\n\nFurthermore, different \"auction_type\" can also provide strategic advantages in certain scenarios. For example, a sealed bid auction might be more suitable for highly valuable or unique items where confidential bids can lead to higher final sale prices.\n\n\nEssential Features in Online and OnLive Auctions on KATON\n\nAdding different \"auction_type\" allows KATON to cater to various auction formats and bidder preferences.

For example, a sealed bid auction might be more suitable for highly valuable or unique items where confidential bids can lead to higher final sale prices.\n\nKATON offers a comprehensive suite of features for creating and managing both Online and OnLive auctions. While these auction types share several core functionalities, they also possess distinct characteristics tailored to their specific formats. This document outlines the essential features common to both auction types and highlights the key differences between them.\nCore Features for All Auction Types\nAuction Title and Description\n\nEvery auction is equipped with a unique title and a descriptive text, providing a clear and concise overview of the auction's focus.\nImage Assignment\n\nA representative image is associated with each auction, offering a visual reference for potential bidders.\n\nStart and End Dates: Administrators set specific start and end dates for each auction, defining the time frame for bidding activities.\nIndividual Starting Price for Each Lot\n\nEach lot can be assigned a distinct starting price, allowing flexibility in pricing strategies based on the item's perceived value.\nBid Price Increment Settings\n\nThe platform enables setting custom bid increments for each auction. This feature allows control over how bids escalate, enhancing the bidding strategy.\nAuction Trailer\n\nA multimedia trailer can be added to provide a more engaging and comprehensive preview of the auction.\nTags for Advertising Campaigns\n\nAuctions can be tagged with relevant keywords to assist in targeted marketing and promotional efforts.\nCustomizable Lot Ordering\n\nA unique feature across both auction types is the ability to customize the order of lots. This can be done either manually in the admin panel or by uploading an order file in Excel format. This flexibility allows auctioneers to strategically arrange lots, irrespective of their lot numbers, to maximize interest and bidding activity.\nDistinguishing Features of OnLive Auctions\n\nIn addition to the shared features, OnLive auctions have specific functionalities that set them apart from purely online auctions:\nPre-Auction Integration (OnLive Exclusive)\n\nOnLive auctions offer the option to conduct a preliminary Pre-Auction. This initial phase functions like a standard auction, with the final bids setting the starting points for the OnLive event.\nDynamic Conclusion\n\nUnlike online auctions with a fixed end date, OnLive auctions conclude in real-time during the live event, adding an element of immediacy and excitement.\n\n\nTimed Online Auction\nPrinciple\n\nIn a Timed Auction, the end of the auction is determined strictly by the passage of time. A specific date and time are set in advance, marking the auction's closure.\nFunctioning \n\nAs the auction progresses, bidders place their bids. The bidding remains open and active until the predetermined closing time is reached. There is usually a visible countdown timer for the auction to keep participants informed about the remaining time.\nChallenges\n\nOne challenge is the potential for 'sniping,' where bids placed at the very last second can win the auction, sometimes before other bidders have the chance to respond. To counter this, some platforms implement an automatic time extension if a bid is placed near the end time.\n\n\nGrouped Online Auctions\nPrinciple\n\nGrouped auctions represent a sophisticated approach to online bidding, where multiple items (or 'lots') are categorized into distinct groups. This format allows bidders to focus on a specific set of related items, enhancing the auction experience and potentially increasing the value and interest in each group.\nFunctioning\nStructure\n\nIn these auctions, items are organized into groups, each containing multiple lots. This structure helps bidders to navigate and concentrate on their interests more efficiently.\nAuction End\n\nEach group has a predefined end time. However, these end times are dynamic and can change based on bidding activity, particularly late bids.\nDynamic Time Extension\n\nA critical feature of confluence grouped auctions is the extension of auction time for a lot if bids are placed in the final minutes. The specific duration for this extension is determined by the auction administrator. This mechanism keeps the auction competitive and fair, allowing bidders who act at the last minute to participate fully.\nVisibility\n\nOnce a lot is sold, it is marked distinctively, often with a transparent overlay, indicating its sold status while still allowing for its details to be viewed.\n\nGroup Closure: A group within the auction is considered closed only when all lots in that group are sold. This process ensures that interest in all items of a group is sustained until the end of the auction.\nNavigation\n\nThe auction platform typically allows users to navigate efficiently, with features such as clicking on group headings to view details of the sold lots.\n\n\nimage-20240204-114859.png\n\n\nOnLive Auction\n\nOnLive Auctions represent an innovative blend of traditional in-person auctions and modern online streaming technology. These auctions occur at a physical venue, similar to conventional auctions, yet they incorporate a unique element: real-time online participation. This hybrid model allows users to view a live stream of the auction and place bids from anywhere in the world, creating a dynamic and inclusive auction experience.\nPrinciple\n\nThe core principle of OnLive Auctions is to merge the excitement and authenticity of physical auctions with the accessibility and convenience of online platforms. At the physical venue, an auctioneer conducts the auction in real time, presenting each lot to an audience. Simultaneously, this event is streamed live to online users who can watch and participate in the bidding process from their devices. This dual approach ensures a broad reach and participation, enhancing the competitive atmosphere typical of auctions.\nFunctioning\n\nLive Stream Integration: A high-quality live stream broadcasts the auction from the venue to online users, ensuring they feel as if they are part of the event.\nBidding Process\n\nUsers can place bids online in real time. At the venue, an administrator inputs bids received from the physical audience into the system, which also registers online bids. This ensures a seamless and fair bidding process for all participants.\nAuctioneer's Dashboard\n\nThe auctioneer at the venue has a dashboard to view all incoming bids, both from in-person and online bidders, allowing for a smooth conduct of the auction.\nVisualization of Bids\n\nBids are visually displayed to the physical audience on a large LED wall, showcasing the bid amount and the flag of the bidder's country. This feature adds an international and interactive dimension to the event.\nVisibility and Navigation\nAlerts and Countdowns\n\nOnline users receive alerts when the auctioneer begins the final countdown for a lot - \"going once, going twice, and sold.\" This feature keeps them engaged and informed about the auction's progression.\nSale Confirmation\n\nBoth the physical and online audiences are notified when a lot is sold. For online users, a visual indicator confirms the sale, ensuring they are up-to-date with the auction's outcomes.\nTransition Between Lots\n\nAs one lot is sold and the next is introduced, online users witness this transition visually. The sold lot is archived under \"sold lots,\" and the new lot is displayed with its image and relevant parameters. This smooth transition helps online users to follow the auction's progression easily and prepares them for upcoming bidding opportunities.\n\n\n\"Buy Now\" Feature\n\nThe \"Buy Now\" feature represents a significant evolution in the auction landscape, offering an alternative to the traditional, competitive bidding process. This feature allows bidders to immediately purchase an item at a set price, bypassing the usual auction dynamics. It caters to both buyers seeking certainty and convenience, and sellers desiring a swift transaction.\nPrinciple of 'Buy Now'\n\nAt its core, \"Buy Now\" is a straightforward and efficient purchasing option within an auction context. It provides an immediate and definitive opportunity for buyers to acquire an item at a predetermined price, circumventing the need to engage in potentially lengthy and uncertain bidding wars. This feature is integrated into the auction platform, coexisting with the standard bidding process.\nFunctioning of 'Buy Now'\n\n\"Buy Now\" introduces a fixed price for the item, distinctly set apart from the fluctuating nature of auction bids. Upon finding the \"Buy Now\" price acceptable, a bidder can instantly confirm their purchase, thereby ending the auction for that particular item.\n\nThis option is typically available from the start of the auction until the first traditional bid is placed or until the \"Buy Now\" option is exercised.\n\n\nGeo-Restricted Online Auctions\n\nGeo-restricted online auctions are a specialized form of online auction where the visibility and participation are limited to users from specific countries pre-selected by the administrators. This approach is often adopted for reasons such as compliance with local laws, shipping constraints, or targeted marketing strategies. By restricting access based on geographic location, these auctions offer a tailored and regulated bidding environment.\nPrinciple of Geo-Restricted Online Auctions\n\nThe fundamental principle behind geo-restricted online auctions is to create an exclusive auction environment that is accessible only to users in certain countries. This exclusivity is often driven by the need to adhere to the legal and commercial requirements specific to different regions. The auctions are hosted online, similar to standard online auctions, but with an added layer of geo-restriction.\nFunctioning of Geo-Restricted Online Auctions\n\nCountry Selection: Before the auction goes live, administrators select the countries whose residents will be allowed to access and participate in the auction. This selection is often based on legal, economic, or strategic considerations.\nGeo-Location Verification\n\nWhen a user attempts to access the auction, their IP address is checked to determine their geographic location. Only users from the approved countries are granted access.\nParticipation Controls\n\nUsers from non-approved countries are either redirected to a notification page explaining the restriction or are simply unable to see or interact with the auction listings.\nVisibility and Navigation\n\nFor users within the approved countries, the online auction operates typically. They can browse listings, place bids, and view auction progress as they would in any standard online auction.\n\nUsers attempting to access the auction from non-approved countries receive clear communication about the restrictions, often with reasons for the limitation. This helps in maintaining transparency and user trust.\n\n\nOnline Auction Freeze Feature\n\nIn the realm of online auctions, technical issues can arise, potentially disrupting the auction process. To address this, a specialized feature known as the \"Auction Freeze\" function is implemented. This feature allows administrators or superadmins to temporarily halt the auction, creating a controlled environment to resolve technical problems without compromising the auction's integrity or the participants' experience.\n\nThe Auction Freeze feature is a crucial tool in ensuring the integrity and smooth operation of online auctions.

This immediately halts all auction activities, including bidding, countdowns, and any other dynamic elements.\nTroubleshooting\n\nDuring the freeze, developers can investigate and rectify the issue without the pressure of ongoing auction activities. This pause is essential for a thorough and unobstructed resolution process.\nControlled Resumption\n\nOnce the issue is resolved, the admin has the capability to resume the auction. They can choose to restart the auction from the exact point of interruption or adjust the conditions if necessary (e.g., extending time limits).\nNotification System\n\nAs soon as the auction is frozen, an automated notification system alerts all participants about the pause. This notification includes the reason for the interruption and, if possible, an estimated duration for the resolution process.\nStatus Updates\n\nRegular updates are provided to keep participants informed about the ongoing resolution efforts and the expected time for resuming the auction.\nResumption Notification\n\nOnce the issue is resolved, participants are notified about the auction's resumption, including any adjustments made to the auction parameters post-freeze.\n\n\nEliteBid Invitational\n\nEliteBid Invitational represents a specialized format of online auctions, tailored to create an exclusive, invitation-only environment. This model is designed for auctions where participation is limited to a select group of pre-registered and vetted users. Such a format is particularly suitable for high-value, niche, or confidential auctions where the organizer seeks to maintain a controlled and curated audience.\nPrinciple\n\nThe core principle of EliteBid Invitational is exclusivity and personalization. Unlike open online auctions, where anyone can participate, this format is restrictive, aiming to create a more private and secure auction environment. This approach is especially appealing for auctions involving high-value items, sensitive goods, or when a more intimate and focused bidding audience is desired.\nFunctioning\nPre-registration and Vetting\n\nUsers must pre-register and may undergo a vetting process to be eligible for participation. This ensures that only qualified and interested bidders are in attendance.\nInvitation Dispatch\n\nOnce registered and approved, users receive a personalized invitation to participate in the auction. This invitation may include a unique access code or a secure link to the auction platform.\nRestricted Access\n\nAccess to the auction is strictly controlled. Only users who have received and accepted the invitation can enter the auction platform and participate in bidding.\nVisibility\n\nInvited participants gain access to auction listings that are not visible to the general public.

It empowers administrators to swiftly and effectively manage bidder participation, particularly in cases where identity verification or bid legitimacy is in question. This feature reinforces the commitment to conducting transparent and trustworthy auctions, maintaining the high standards of integrity that are foundational to the OnLive Auction experience.\nFunctionality\n\nImmediate Suspension Access: During an Online or OnLive Auction, administrators have the capability to suspend a bidder's account in real-time. This is facilitated through an interface where each bidder's name is accompanied by a suspension icon. By clicking this icon, administrators can instantly deactivate the account of the bidder in question.\nSecurity and Verification\n\nThis feature is crucial in scenarios where there are uncertainties or concerns about a bidder's identity or the legitimacy of their bidding activity. It acts as a vital safeguard against potential fraudulent or unverified participants, thereby preserving the auction's integrity.\nImpact of Suspension\n\nOnce an account is suspended, the affected user is immediately restricted from further participation in the auction. Their existing bids can be reviewed and potentially invalidated, depending on the circumstances and at the discretion of the auction administrators.\nNotification and Clarity\nAffected bidders are notified about the suspension of their account, along with an explanation for this action. This approach ensures transparency and provides an opportunity for the bidder to understand and possibly rectify the situation that led to their suspension.\n\nFrom the text above, please extract nodes and significant relationships to construct a knowledge graph.\nFeel free to use standard relations like IS_A (for class or subset relationships) and EQ (for semantic equivalences), but also consider identifying and defining additional relationships as needed to capture the full complexity of the information:\nExamples of custom relations could include CAUSES, REQUIRES, ENABLES, PART_OF, etc.\nPresent your findings in the following JSON structure:\n{ \"nodes\": [\"node1\", \"node2\", \"node3\"], \"relations\": [[\"node1\", \"IS_A\", \"node2\"], [\"node2\", \"PART_OF\", \"node3\"]] }": "{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    \"KATON\",\n    \"Online Auction\",\n    \"OnLive Auction\",\n    \"auction_type\",\n    \"Core Features\",\n    \"Auction Title and Description\",\n    \"Image Assignment\",\n    \"Individual Starting Price for Each Lot\",\n    \"Bid Price Increment Settings\",\n    \"Auction Trailer\",\n    \"Tags for Advertising Campaigns\",\n    \"Customizable Lot Ordering\",\n    \"Distinguishing Features of OnLive Auctions\",\n    \"Pre-Auction Integration\",\n    \"Dynamic Conclusion\",\n    \"Timed Online Auction\",\n    \"Grouped Online Auctions\",\n    \"OnLive Auction Principle\",\n    \"Buy Now Feature\",\n    \"Geo-Restricted Online Auctions\",\n    \"Online Auction Freeze Feature\",\n    \"EliteBid Invitational\",\n    \"Enhanced Security Feature\",\n    \"Bidder Account Suspension Capability\",\n    \"Pre-registration and Vetting\",\n    \"Invitation Dispatch\",\n    \"Restricted Access\",\n    \"Visibility\",\n    \"Navigation\"\n  ],\n  \"relations\": [\n    [\"Online Auction\", \"IS_A\", \"auction_type\"],\n    [\"OnLive Auction\", \"IS_A\", \"auction_type\"],\n    [\"Auction Title and Description\", \"PART_OF\", \"Core Features\"],\n    [\"Image Assignment\", \"PART_OF\", \"Core Features\"],\n    [\"Individual Starting Price for Each Lot\", \"PART_OF\", \"Core Features\"],\n    [\"Bid Price Increment Settings\", \"PART_OF\", \"Core Features\"],\n    [\"Auction Trailer\", \"PART_OF\", \"Core Features\"],\n    [\"Tags for Advertising Campaigns\", \"PART_OF\", \"Core Features\"],\n    [\"Customizable Lot Ordering\", \"PART_OF\", \"Core Features\"],\n    [\"Pre-Auction Integration\", \"IS_A\", \"Distinguishing Features of OnLive Auctions\"],\n    [\"Dynamic Conclusion\", \"IS_A\", \"Distinguishing Features of OnLive Auctions\"],\n    [\"Timed Online Auction\", \"IS_A\", \"Online Auction\"],\n    [\"Grouped Online Auctions\", \"IS_A\", \"Online Auction\"],\n    [\"OnLive Auction Principle\", \"UNIQUE_TO\", \"OnLive Auction\"],\n    [\"Buy Now Feature\", \"AVAILABLE_IN\", \"Online Auction\"],\n    [\"Geo-Restricted Online Auctions\", \"IS_A\", \"Online Auction\"],\n    [\"Online Auction Freeze Feature\", \"AVAILABLE_IN\", \"Online Auction\"],\n    [\"EliteBid Invitational\", \"IS_A\", \"Online Auction\"],\n    [\"Enhanced Security Feature\", \"AVAILABLE_IN\", [\"Online Auction\", \"OnLive Auction\"]],\n    [\"Bidder Account Suspension Capability\", \"PART_OF\", \"Enhanced Security Feature\"],\n    [\"Pre-registration and Vetting\", \"PART_OF\", \"EliteBid Invitational\"],\n    [\"Invitation Dispatch\", \"PART_OF\", \"EliteBid Invitational\"],\n    [\"Restricted Access\", \"PART_OF\", \"EliteBid Invitational\"],\n    [\"Visibility\", \"RELATED_TO\", [\"Online Auction\", \"OnLive Auction\", \"EliteBid Invitational\"]],\n    [\"Navigation\", \"ESSENTIAL_FOR\", [\"Online Auction\", \"OnLive Auction\"]]\n  ]\n}",
  "As the AI assistant, your task is to analyze project documentation to construct a detailed knowledge graph. This involves not just identifying concepts and entities but also the diverse relationships between them.\n\nYou are processing the text provided below:\n\nOn a regular basis (for example: every two weeks), all the libraries and software we rely on should be updated to the latest stable version, in order to ensure we have the latest fixes and features.\nFrontend\n\nSwitch into the admin-frontend/ directory and enter the following command:\n\nyarn upgrade-interactive --latest\n\nNow you can select the packages with available updates using space.\nimage-20240304-145925.png\n\nOnce finished, press enter to perform the update. Finally, commit the package.json and yarn.lock and create a merge request to run the automated tests. You should also start and check the client manually to ensure everything is still working.\n\n \nimage-20240304-150134.png\n\n \nAPI\n\nThe backend is based on PHP Language so its package manager composer can be used to check for outdated packages and update them.\n\nFirst, in the api project, we need to run the command composer outdated it will output a list of outdated packages. The list is made of Direct dependences and Transitive dependencies. The last kind of outdated dependences are not required to be updated because we do not require them directly but they may need attention to check if the change log is about security or if there is any new performance for us. In case the package we are directly depending on is updated then it can also update its transitive outdated dependences as well.\nimage-20240429-152354.png\n\nFor our Direct dependences we need to check if the update has any break changes in their implementation before applying their update.\n\nTo apply the update, we need to run the command composer update to update all dependencies that are outdated or provide the name of the package to be updated.\n\nIt is also great to run following command composer audit to check for any dependency that has a security vulnerability.\n\nFrom the text above, please extract nodes and significant relationships to construct a knowledge graph.\nFeel free to use standard relations like IS_A (for class or subset relationships) and EQ (for semantic equivalences), but also consider identifying and defining additional relationships as needed to capture the full complexity of the information:\nExamples of custom relations could include CAUSES, REQUIRES, ENABLES, PART_OF, etc.\nPresent your findings in the following JSON structure:\n{ \"nodes\": [\"node1\", \"node2\", \"node3\"], \"relations\": [[\"node1\", \"IS_A\", \"node2\"], [\"node2\", \"PART_OF\", \"node3\"]] }": "{\n  \"nodes\": [\n    \"Update Libraries and Software\",\n    \"every two weeks\",\n    \"latest stable version\",\n    \"latest fixes and features\",\n    \"Frontend\",\n    \"Admin-frontend directory\",\n    \"yarn upgrade-interactive --latest command\",\n    \"packages with available updates\",\n    \"merge request\",\n    \"automated tests\",\n    \"check client manually\",\n    \"API\",\n    \"PHP Language\",\n    \"Composer\",\n    \"composer outdated command\",\n    \"Direct dependencies\",\n    \"Transitive dependencies\",\n    \"security or performance updates\",\n    \"composer update command\",\n    \"composer audit command\",\n    \"dependency security vulnerability\",\n    \"image-20240304-145925.png\",\n    \"image-20240304-150134.png\",\n    \"image-20240429-152354.png\",\n    \"package.json\",\n    \"yarn.lock\"\n  ],\n  \"relations\": [\n    [\"Update Libraries and Software\", \"OCCURS_EVERY\", \"every two weeks\"],\n    [\"Update Libraries and Software\", \"AIMS_FOR\", \"latest stable version\"],\n    [\"latest stable version\", \"PROVIDES\", \"latest fixes and features\"],\n    [\"Frontend\", \"IS_PART_OF\", \"Update Libraries and Software\"],\n    [\"Admin-frontend directory\", \"USED_FOR\", \"Frontend\"],\n    [\"yarn upgrade-interactive --latest command\", \"USED_IN\", \"Admin-frontend directory\"],\n    [\"packages with available updates\", \"SELECTED_BY\", \"yarn upgrade-interactive --latest command\"],\n    [\"merge request\", \"FOR\", \"automated tests\"],\n    [\"check client manually\", \"VERIFIES\", \"Frontend\"],\n    [\"API\", \"IS_PART_OF\", \"Update Libraries and Software\"],\n    [\"PHP Language\", \"USED_BY\", \"API\"],\n    [\"Composer\", \"PACKAGE_MANAGER_FOR\", \"PHP Language\"],\n    [\"composer outdated command\", \"OUTPUTS\", \"Direct dependencies\"],\n    [\"composer outdated command\", \"OUTPUTS\", \"Transitive dependencies\"],\n    [\"Direct dependencies\", \"REQUIRE_VERIFICATION_FOR\", \"security or performance updates\"],\n    [\"Transitive dependencies\", \"MAY_REQUIRE\", \"security or performance updates\"],\n    [\"composer update command\", \"UPDATES\", \"Direct dependencies\"],\n    [\"composer audit command\", \"CHECKS_FOR\", \"dependency security vulnerability\"],\n    [\"image-20240304-145925.png\", \"RELATED_TO\", \"yarn upgrade-interactive --latest command\"],\n    [\"image-20240304-150134.png\", \"RELATED_TO\", \"check client manually\"],\n    [\"image-20240429-152354.png\", \"RELATED_TO\", \"composer outdated command\"],\n    [\"package.json\", \"COMMIT_AFTER_UPDATE\", \"Frontend\"],\n    [\"yarn.lock\", \"COMMIT_AFTER_UPDATE\", \"Frontend\"]\n  ]\n}"
